Timer is a **web app** which implements a **time management technique** which is slightly different from the popular **Pomodoro Technique**. In the Promodora technique the work is divided into smaller intervals of time as remaining focus for long hours is difficult.

**Promodora Technique:**
* Work Time:   25 mins
* Small Break: 5 mins
* Work Time:   25 mins
* Small Break: 5 mins
* Long Break:   15 mins

**Modified Technique**.
* Work Time:   50 mins
* Small Break: 10 mins
* Work Time:   50 mins
* Small Break: 10 mins
* Work Time:   30 mins
* Long Break:  30 mins

The modified technique doubles the time intervals in the Promodora technique.
