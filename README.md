Pomodora is a time management technique which uses a timer to break down work into intervals followed by a small break as focusing for long intervals is difficult. The web app build here can be used as the timer when implementing Pomodora.

**Promodora Technique:**
* Work Time:   25 mins
* Small Break: 5 mins
* Work Time:   25 mins
* Small Break: 5 mins
* Long Break:  15 mins

**Modified Technique**.
* Work Time:   50 mins
* Small Break: 10 mins
* Work Time:   50 mins
* Small Break: 10 mins
* Work Time:   30 mins
* Long Break:  30 mins

The modified technique doubles the time intervals in the Promodora technique.
